\section{Introduction}\label{sec:firstsection}

%% give some background on importance and relevance of universal design
%% explain issue that needs to be addressed using this concept
%% mention this is a new project

To increase the accessibility of the MEGAphone mobile device, this project aims to create a universally designed case for the current revision of the project.
The intention is to give enhanced telephony access to everyone, regardless of physical impairments. 
The term ‘Universal Design’ is a concept first coined by Ron Mace where “the design of products, environments, programmes and services to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design” \cite{nda}. 
Existing design principles developed by the Center for Universal Design at North Carolina State University \cite{sevenprinciples} will be adopted to help guide this project in the right direction.

This is a new project, which will require Autodesk 3D CAD modeling software (or equivalent) in order to successfully translate concept sketches into real tangible designs. 
Inclusive design practices will play a central role in the design process as the success of the final product depends on its ability to provide accessibility to all (regardless of age or disability). 
Universal Design is an iterative process and therefore must be at the centre of the design philosophy from the start \cite{incldesign}. 
This project does have existing constraints, in that it is adapted around an existing PCB, however this design will take every opportunity to uphold the aforementioned design philosophy, as well as a possible redesign following these design practices.
Additionally, this project will look into how UD can incorporate digital sovereignty so that users can not only have an accessible interface, but one that can be easily repaired, modified and controlled by them.

\section{Background on the MEGAphone}

%% how was this project formed, and who works on it
The ‘MEGAphone’ is a digitally sovereign mobile device created by Dr Paul Gardner-Stephen with the intent to promote digital sovereignty \cite{mega65}.
This project began when a trend was noticed in modern consumer electronics, in that they design their products with ‘planned obsolescence’ in mind. 
Gardner-Stephen believes that users should have the ability to repair or modify any aspect of their device without difficulty \cite{mobilehistory}.

%% explain the purpose of FPGA, and security features
The MEGAphone incorporates the use of a field programmable gate-array (FPGA), a hardware programmable CPU designed to mimic a Commodore 64 processor. 
This removes the need for emulation as well as providing modern performance advancements partially due to eliminating the need for costly emulation.

\section{Project Objectives}

The main objective of this project, as outlined in the thesis is to design a prototype case for the MEGAphone that follows the seven Universal Design (UD) principles established at the Universal Design branch of the North Carolina State University (Story, 1998). 
This thesis will also aim to document the process of design as well as any modifications to the design and why these changes were made. 
In terms of the research component, this thesis aims to address the relevance of UD in the design process as well as identifying how device sovereignty can be supported during this process. 
The desired output of this project as is documented will be a physical prototype of the MEGAphone case as well as software-side accessibility features for the MEGA65 operating system. 
A physical prototype of this project will allow for demonstration of the UD features.

\section{Research Questions}

This thesis aims to answer multiple research questions:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item What is the relationship between digital sovereignty and universal design?
    \item Why is Universal Design important in the design of products today?
    \item How can the MEGAphone device case be designed to support those with disabilities?
    \item What are the effects of COVID-19 on digital sovereignty and how does that affect the MEGAphone?
    \end{itemize}
